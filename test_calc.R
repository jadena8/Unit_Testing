#This function takes in a msa to check whether or not the sequences are in a FASTA format.
#If the sequences are in FASTA format, they will pass, if not they will fail the unit test
#
#Input: msa <- a multiple sequence alignment read in from a file
#Output: A PASS or FAIL to see if the sequences passed or failed the unit test
#           if failed: the code will also print out the sequence number that failed the unit test
#
#test_calc function: check to see if the sequences are in FASTA format since I customized the alignment. Will check for > on the first line and for sequences on the next.
