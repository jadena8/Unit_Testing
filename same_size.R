#This function is to take a multiple sequence alignment (MSAs) and determine if they are the same size. 
#The sequences need to be the same size in order to generate a square matrix for calculation.
#
#Input: msa <- a multiple sequence alignment read in from a file
#
#same_size Function: Check to see if all sequences in the file are the same length
#
#

same_size <- function(msa){
